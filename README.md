# Social-Buzz

Social Buzz is a repository of the work I have done as part of the Accenture Virtual Internship program, a free self-paced virtual experience for building skills on a real world problem and dataset.

My role in the internship was as a Data Analyst at Accenture, where I was working with a large team with each team member having a different role and level of responsibility. I was assigned a project called as Social Buzz. 

These are the tasks I have worked on in the project:

1. Project Understanding
2. Data Cleaning & Modelling
3. Data Visualization & Storytelling
4. Presentation to Client
