# Social-Buzz

Social Buzz is a repository of the work I have done as part of the Accenture Virtual Internship program, a free self-paced virtual experience for building skills on a real world problem and dataset.

My role in the internship was as a Data Analyst at Accenture, where I was working with a large team with each team member having a different role and level of responsibility. I was assigned a project called as Social Buzz. 

These are the tasks I have worked on in the project:

## 1. Project Understanding
This task was a project brief on:
   - Understanding the client and business problem at hand.
   - Identifying the requirements that need to be delivered for the project.
   - Identifying the tasks to focus on as a Data Analyst.
   
## 2. Data Cleaning & Modelling
This task involved analyzing 7 datasets and creating a data model to merge tables. The following steps were followed to make sure I am using the right data to answer the business question - 
    - Requirements gathering
    - Data cleaning
    - Data modelling
    
    
## 3. Data Visualization & Storytelling
After cleaning the dataset and doing analysis, the next step was to communicate the relevant insights in a concise and engaging way for client and team members to understand. This involved bringing the data to life using visualizations. I chose data visualizations that best supported the story I wanted to tell.

## 4. Presentation to Client
In this step after presenting to client, this step involved presenting the findings to client.
